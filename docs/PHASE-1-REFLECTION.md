# TDD Cycle Reflection - Phase 1 Completion

## Date: 2025-05-29
## Phase: 1 - Mod Setup & Hello World

### Completed Tasks:
- ✅ HelloTerrainMod TDD cycle with comprehensive tests
- ✅ Gradle build system working correctly
- ✅ JaCoCo coverage reporting configured
- ✅ Git workflow with proper commit messages

### Key Learnings:

#### Test Package Structure (CRITICAL):
- **Issue**: Placed test files in wrong package initially
- **Solution**: Always create `src/test/java/com/rhythmatician/lodiffusion/` structure first
- **Updated Process**: Check package structure before writing any test code

#### Test Simplicity Principle:
- **Issue**: Over-engineered mocking for static logger
- **Solution**: Focus on behavior verification that matters
- **Updated Approach**: Start with simple assertions, add complexity only when needed

#### Git Workflow Discipline:
- **Issue**: Created duplicate files and messy working tree
- **Solution**: Regular `git status` checks and cleanup before commits
- **Updated Process**: Stage, review, clean, then commit

#### Coverage Monitoring:
- **Issue**: JaCoCo not reporting HelloTerrainMod class coverage properly
- **Action Item**: Investigate coverage configuration for next phase

### Next Phase Improvements:
1. Package structure validation before test creation
2. Incremental commits during TDD cycles
3. Coverage validation as part of test completion
4. Simpler initial test approaches

### TDD Cycle Rating: 8/10
- Strong adherence to red-green-refactor
- Good test coverage and behavior verification
- Room for improvement in process efficiency and organization
