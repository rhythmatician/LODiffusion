Absolutely ‚Äî you've advanced far enough that it's time to upgrade the **project outline from a sketch to a blueprint**. You're no longer in a phase of ‚Äúget it working‚Äù; you‚Äôre in a phase of **architecting a scalable and extensible diffusion-driven terrain mod**. Here's a proposed revision that reflects the real structure of your codebase, what Copilot is doing well, and where model training, terrain fidelity, and mod compatibility are heading.

## üî≠ **AI-Diffusion Minecraft Mod ‚Äì LODiffusion**

### üéØ **Mission**

Generate plausible terrain in distant chunks using a **discrete diffusion model**, with progressive fidelity across Levels of Detail (LODs), tightly integrated with Distant Horizons.

---

## üß≠ **Refined Project Roadmap**

### **PHASE 0 ‚Äî Developer Infrastructure (Done)**

* [x] Git + GitHub Actions with PR CI + Jacoco + Lint
* [x] Fabric mod scaffolding + Java 17 + Gradle 8.x
* [x] Copilot terminal permissions, auto-merge prep, TDD config
* [x] Testing suite bootstrapped with JUnit 5 + Mockito

---

### **PHASE 1 ‚Äî Core Diffusion Engine (Complete ‚úÖ)**

* [x] Implemented multi-pass, tile-aware `DiffusionModel.run()`
* [x] Added LOD-sensitive diffusion with LOD intensity maps
* [x] Introduced multi-channel support: `float[][][]` (height, biome, temp)
* [x] Integrated LOD blending with `getTileEdgeFactor`
* [x] Verified via 90+ unit tests + real-world .mca patch tests
* [x] 70%+ line coverage with full CI compliance

---

### **PHASE 2 ‚Äî World Integration & Hook Points (In Progress)**

* [x] `DiffusionChunkGenerator.buildSurface(...)` overloads implemented
* [x] `LODManagerCompat` with fallback for Distant Horizons
* [x] `DistantHorizonsCompat` provides runtime-safe API calls
* [x] Partial registration for world generation APIs (DH pending)

**TODO:**

* [ ] Full implementation of `IDhApiWorldGenerator` registration
* [ ] Fallback chunk generation logic when DH is not loaded
* [ ] Add configurable parameters for LOD tuning in-game

---

### **PHASE 3 ‚Äî Data Extraction for Training (Planned üß™)**

* [ ] Use `ChunkDataExtractor` to convert `.mca` regions into 8x8 patches
* [ ] Support vanilla + modded biome decoding (with palette + NBT)
* [ ] Export `.npy` or `.pt` format data for ML consumption
* [ ] Optional: Export Distant Horizons LODs for ground-truth A/B testing

---

### **PHASE 4 ‚Äî Model Training Pipeline**

* [ ] `train.py`: U-Net with sinusoidal timestep embedding
* [ ] Conditional input: height + biome classmap (optional)
* [ ] Output: multi-scale diffusion (e.g., Œîheightmaps)
* [ ] Export: ONNX + metadata (input format, LOD scale factors)
* [ ] Quantized model for runtime use (DJL or custom)

---

### **PHASE 5 ‚Äî Runtime Inference Engine**

* [ ] Implement `DiffusionRunner` in Java
* [ ] Load ONNX model using DJL or custom JNI backend
* [ ] Predict terrain patches at runtime with cache/memoization
* [ ] Validate runtime outputs via visual debug overlays

---

### **PHASE 6 ‚Äî Tuning, Debugging, UI**

* [ ] Add debug UI to visualize LODs and model output
* [ ] Toggle between vanilla and AI terrain modes
* [ ] Per-biome tuning of model parameters
* [ ] Performance benchmarking at multiple view distances

---

### **PHASE 7 ‚Äî Packaging, Distribution**

* [ ] Embed metadata (model hash, training stats) into mod
* [ ] Document setup, inference engine, patch generation
* [ ] Release build with modrinth & curseforge descriptors
* [ ] Auto-pack example-world & test suite for public use

## üìå Recommendations to Implement Next

1. **Split Phase 4 into a `/training` subdir with**:

   * `train.py`
   * `extract-patches.py`
   * `README.md` documenting patch formats + usage

2. **Write a sample `TerrainPatchDataset` class** in PyTorch to load `.npy`/`.pt` patches.

3. **Update `PROJECT-OUTLINE.md` with this refined blueprint.**

4. **Write a simple benchmark test** in `tests/benchmark/InferenceBenchmarkTest.java` to simulate runtime model invocation (even if stubbed).

Would you like me to directly rewrite your `PROJECT-OUTLINE.md` file with this enhanced structure?
